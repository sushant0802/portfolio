 this process is simple and easy to implement, and works with only HTML.
  I'll first teach you how to receive email from your website contact form using FormSubmit,
   and then I'll move on to teach you how to send the fully functional 
   form to your email using Formspree. Both of these services and free and easy to use,
    so it should take you just a few minutes to start receiving emails from your 
    website contact form.}
